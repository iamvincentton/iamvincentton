### 👨‍💻 About Me:

I am a Full Stack Developer with 7+ years of experience and a proven track record of delivering quality Full Stack applications in both startup and enterprise environments. I work best with the modern JavaScript stack including React, Vue, Node, GraphQL and TypeScript as well as the Blockchain ecosystem. I also have experience on the Cloud with AWS.

From my days as a Business Analyst, playing around with VBA and Excel Macros, I decided to pivot my career and become a full stack developer. I took specific training and courses to equip myself with modern JavaScript technologies like React, Vue.js, and Node. This set the stage for my move into full-stack and Blockchain development.

At present, I'm a part of a dynamic team as a Full Stack Developer. While I predominantly contribute across the fullstack (TypeScript, React, Vue, Node.js) and manage our cloud infrastructure (Azure DevOps). In my free time, I enjoy improving my physical condition by running or doing fitness.
